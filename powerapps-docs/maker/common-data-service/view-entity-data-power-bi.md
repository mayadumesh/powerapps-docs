# View entity data in Power BI Desktop (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can use Power BI Desktop to view entities in Common Data Service. The entity
record data that you can access from your environment is ready-only. Data access
uses the Common Data Service security model that is the same used to access
entity record data using a Power Apps app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature, and isn't available in all regions.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

     - Setting Value: https://disco.<domain E.g. crm3.dyanics.com>/XrmServices/2011/Discovery.svc

      <runtime>
          <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto=false"/>
      </runtime>
      
     6. Run the command     
          - Microsoft.Crm.SE.OrgDBOrgSettingsTool Update /u <org unique name> EnableTDSEndpoint true

    appropriate environment from the top-right corner.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't have the **Analyze in Power BI** option in your Power Apps environment, you don't yet have access to the SQL connection feature.

3.  Open the .pbids file to access it in Power BI Desktop. Don’t have Power BI
    Desktop? [Get it now](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/downloads/).

4.  The pbids file is loaded in Power BI Desktop. In the **SQL Server database**
    dialog box, select **Microsoft account**, select **Sign in**, and then in
